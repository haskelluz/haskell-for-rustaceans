# Preface

I initially started working on this handbook as a help for my Rustacean friend who was trying to learn Haskell. After
pondering for a while I figured that it would be useful to write a whole handbook altogether. To give back to community,
hone my teaching and writing skills.

By no means I am an expert in neither of these languages. Therefore, I will **only** be writing about topics that I am
fully confident on. I implore you to report mistakes if you find them. Since misinformation is the worst thing an author
can do.
